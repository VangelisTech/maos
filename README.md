# MAOS 
### Multi-Agent Orchestration System

Purpose
MAOS is designed to help researchers and developers characterize arbitrary networks of agent systems. By combining flexible tooling (e.g., Ray for distributed computing, NetworkX for graph modeling, and other open-source libraries), M.A.O.S. enables users to experiment and simulate agent interactions at scale. This allows for rapid prototyping, benchmarking, and analysis of multi-agent scenarios in diverse domainsâ€”providing an extensible foundation for AI-native solutions and cutting-edge research.
